# About
Python package for supervised &amp; unsupervised learning, and times series.

Algorithms for **supervised learning** include:
- naive Bayes classifier (`bayes`);
- *k*-nearest neighbors (`knns`);
- perceptron algorithm (`percep`);
- kernel perceptron algorithm (`kerpercep`);
- support vector machines (`svm`);
- kernel support vector machines (`kersvm`);
- shallow neural networks (`shallow`).

Algorithms for **unsupervised learning** include:
- *k*-means (`kmeans`).

Algorithms for **time series** include:
- autoregression (`ar`);
- autocorrelation computation (`autocorr`);
- partial autocorrelation computation (`pautocorr`).

Also included:
- Monte Carlo integration (`montecarlo`);
- princpal componenent analysis (`pca`);
- regression (`regression`).

The **examples** folder contains examples for each of these functions. 

The **memos** folder contains PDF files about:
- probability (`proba1.pdf` &amp; `proba2.pdf`); 
- statistics (`stats1.pdf`, `stats2.pdf` &amp; `stats3.pdf`);
- supervised learning (`supervised.pdf`).
