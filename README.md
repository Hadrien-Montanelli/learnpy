# About
Python package for supervised &amp; unsupervised learning, and times series.

Algorithms for **supervised learning** include:
- maximum likelihood estimation (`mle` function);
- *k*-nearest neighbours (`knns` function);
- perceptron algorithm (`perceptron` function);
- support vector machines (`svm` function).

Algorithms for **unsupervised learning** include:
- *k*-means (`kmeans` function).

Algorithms for **time series** include:
- autoregression (`ar` function);
- sample autocorrelation computation (`autocorr` function);
- partial sample autocorrelation computation (`pautocorr` function).

Also included:
- princpal componenent analysis (`pca` function);
- regression (`regression` function).
