# About
Python package for supervised &amp; unsupervised learning, and times series.

Algorithms for **supervised learning** include:
- Bayes classifier (`bayes` function);
- *k*-nearest neighbours (`knns` function);
- perceptron algorithm (`perceptron` function);
- support vector machines (`svm` function).

Algorithms for **unsupervised learning** include:
- *k*-means (`kmeans` function).

Algorithms for **time series** include:
- autoregression (`ar` function);
- autocorrelation computation (`autocorr` function);
- partial autocorrelation computation (`pautocorr` function).

Also included:
- maximum likelihood esitmation (`mle` function);
- princpal componenent analysis (`pca` function);
- regression (`regression` function).

The `examples` folder contains examples for each of these functions. 

The `memos` folder has PDFs about probability (`proba1.pdf` &amp; `proba2.pdf`), statistics (`stats1.pdf`, `stats2.pdf` &amp; `stats3.pdf`), and supervised 
learning (`supervised.pdf`).
